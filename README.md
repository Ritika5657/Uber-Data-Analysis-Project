# Uber Rides Data Analysis

## Project Summary

An **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Uber ride data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover key trip patterns and user behavior. The goal was to process raw trip log data and derive **actionable insights** related to ride categories, popular times, and typical trip distances.

## Key Insights

| Business Question | Key Insight |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Trip Purpose** | The majority of trips are for **Business**, with **Meeting** and **Meal/Entertain** as the most common purposes. |
| **Peak Ride Time** | The highest volume of rides occurs during the **Afternoon** (10:00 AM - 3:00 PM). |
| **Trip Distance** | Most Uber trips are **short-distance**, typically **under 10 miles**. |
| **Monthly Trend** | Ride frequency is highest in **December** and lowest in **August**. |

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Wrangling:** Data cleaning (handling missing data) and date/time feature engineering.
* **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
* **Data Visualization:** Created bar plots, count plots, and distribution plots.
